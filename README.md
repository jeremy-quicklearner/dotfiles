# Dotfiles
My dotfiles. To apply them, type:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/jeremy-quicklearner/dotfiles.git
$ ./dotfiles/setup
```

If you already have a ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, ~/.vimrc, etc., all the config
is **appended** to it.

If you want the latest changes, do a`git pull`in this repo and then run
```
./update
```
